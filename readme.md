1. **Next.js** handles client-side rendering, server-side rendering, and routes (both pages and API endpoints if needed).  
2. **PostGraphile** auto-generates a GraphQL API from the PostgreSQL schema.  
3. **Graphile Migrate** is used to modify and version database schema changes over time.  
4. **MUI** is leveraged within Next.js for all UI components and theming.  
5. **Playwright** is used for end-to-end (E2E) testing of the front-end flows.

## 4. Data Model

Below is a conceptual (not literal code) overview of some key tables. Actual schema creation will be handled via **Graphile Migrate** (written in SQL or via migration scripts).

1. **members**  
   - `id` (PK)  
   - `first_name`  
   - `last_name`  
   - `email` (unique)  
   - `phone_number` (nullable)  
   - `address` (JSON or structured columns for street, city, postal code)  
   - `membership_status` (e.g., ACTIVE, PENDING, EXPIRED)  
   - `created_at`  
   - `updated_at`

2. **memberships**  
   - `id` (PK)  
   - `member_id` (FK to `members.id`)  
   - `start_date`  
   - `end_date`  
   - `membership_tier` (e.g., standard, premium, lifetime)  
   - `fee_paid` (boolean or numeric if storing fee amounts)  

3. **roles**  
   - `id` (PK)  
   - `name` (e.g., MEMBER, ADMIN, SUPERADMIN)  

4. **member_roles** (mapping table to handle many-to-many relationships if needed)  
   - `member_id` (FK to `members.id`)  
   - `role_id` (FK to `roles.id`)  

Depending on the coop’s requirements, you might have additional tables for **transactions**, **fees**, **events**, or **committees**.

## 5. Front-End (Next.js + MUI)

### 5.1 Pages & Routes

- `/` (Home or dashboard)  
- `/login` (for members/admins to sign in)  
- `/register` (for new membership applications)  
- `/profile` (view & edit member info)  
- `/admin` (admin dashboard with membership management, approvals, etc.)

Each page will be a React component styled with MUI. Server-side rendering can be enabled where needed (e.g., `/admin` can require authentication checks on the server).

### 5.2 MUI Usage

- **Theme**: Configure a custom MUI theme (colors, typography) for cohesive branding.  
- **Layout**: Common layouts (header, side nav, footer) using MUI components like `<AppBar>`, `<Drawer>`, `<Toolbar>`, `<Typography>`.  
- **Forms**: Use `<TextField>`, `<Checkbox>`, `<Button>`, etc. for membership registration, profile edits.  
- **Data Tables** (if needed): MUI Table or other approach for admin to see membership lists.

## 6. GraphQL API (PostGraphile)

### 6.1 Auto-Generated Resolvers

PostGraphile automatically creates:

- **Queries** (e.g., `allMembers`, `memberById`)  
- **Mutations** (e.g., `createMember`, `updateMember`, `deleteMember`)  
- **Role-based** access (depending on PostgreSQL role setups and RLS policies)

### 6.2 Custom Logic

If needed:

- **PostGraphile Plugins** or **Smart Comments** to customize how fields are exposed.  
- **Database Functions** and **Triggers** for advanced business logic (e.g., automatically mark membership as expired after `end_date`).

### 6.3 Authentication & Authorization

- Use a **JWT-based** approach, or rely on Next.js API routes to handle session-based auth, then pass relevant user context to PostGraphile.  
- Enforce row-level security (RLS) in Postgres for fine-grained membership data protection.

---

## 7. Migrations (Graphile Migrate)

1. **SQL-first approach**  
   - Write schema changes (e.g., `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`) in `.sql` files.  
   - Use Graphile Migrate’s commands to apply or revert changes in dev, staging, production environments.

2. **Version Control**  
   - Each migration is tracked in Git, ensuring team members can sync changes.  
   - Continuous Integration (CI) can automate applying migrations before test runs.

3. **Workflow**  
   - `graphile-migrate watch` in local dev to apply changes on the fly.  
   - Commit the migration scripts.  
   - Deploy to staging/production and run `graphile-migrate migrate`.

---

## 8. Security Considerations

- **SSL** between Next.js and PostGraphile if hosting separately.  
- **HTTPS** in production for all front-end traffic.  
- **Role-based** permissions in Postgres for queries/mutations (non-admin cannot delete others’ data).  
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)** if multiple users share the same database schema but should only see their own data.

---

## 9. Testing & QA (Playwright)

- **End-to-End Tests**: Use **Playwright** to verify critical user flows (registration, login, membership renewal, admin actions) in a real browser environment.  
- **Integration Tests** (Optional): Test GraphQL queries and mutations either through a Next.js API route or directly against PostGraphile in a test database.  
- **Continuous Integration**: Configure CI (e.g., GitHub Actions) to run the Playwright tests on each push or pull request.

---

## 10. Deployment & Hosting

There are multiple hosting strategies:

- **Option A**: Host everything (Next.js + PostGraphile + Postgres) on a PaaS like Render, Railway, or Fly.io, using free or low-cost tiers for dev/testing.  
- **Option B**: Separate front-end on Vercel (Next.js) and back-end on a service like Render (PostGraphile + Postgres).  
- **Option C**: Self-host on a VPS (DigitalOcean, AWS EC2) with Docker containers for each service.

---

## 11. Roadmap & Next Steps

1. **Initialize Repo**: Set up Next.js, install MUI, configure PostGraphile and Graphile Migrate in a local dev environment.  
2. **Design DB Schema**: Finalize membership tables, roles, etc. with Graphile Migrate.  
3. **Implement Auth**: Decide on JWT vs. session-based auth, secure routes in Next.js, and configure PostGraphile for user context.  
4. **Build Core Pages**:  
   - Registration & login  
   - Profile management  
   - Admin dashboard  
5. **Testing**:  
   - Set up Playwright for E2E tests.  
   - Write initial test cases for membership CRUD and login flows.  
6. **Deployment**:  
   - Choose hosting approach.  
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline for migrations and automated tests.

## 12. Conclusion

By combining **Next.js**, **PostGraphile**, **Graphile Migrate**, **MUI**, and **Playwright**, we get:

- **Modern front-end** with SSR and a robust component library (MUI).  
- **Effortless GraphQL** from Postgres using PostGraphile.  
- **Reliable schema migrations** with Graphile Migrate.  
- **Comprehensive testing** with Playwright for end-to-end validation.  
- **Scalable architecture** suitable for a cooperative membership management system.

The next phase is to implement the database schema with Graphile Migrate, integrate PostGraphile in a Next.js app, build out the membership features using MUI components, and set up Playwright E2E tests to ensure the system works as intended.
